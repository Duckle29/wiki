title: "Modify a Page"

Modifying a page is as simple as changing the _index.md file inside of a folder.

    \ content
      _index.md <-- This here

        \ Subfolder
          _index.md   <-- or this one.

        \ Subfolder2
          _index.md    <-- or even this one too.

Hugo uses Markdown to format and style text, among other things.
