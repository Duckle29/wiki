# /r/Selfhosted Official Wiki

This is the home of the full site source for the Hugo project that hosts the /r/selfhosted official wiki.

## Contributing

You'll need to submit a pull request in order to submit content. If you just want to edit a typo or add a small correction to an existing document, feel free to edit it directly using the Github web-based edit function. Otherwise, refer to the local machine setup instructions below.

## Community

Check out [/r/selfhosted](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted) for the full details of what we represent and do.

## Local Machine Setup

### Installing Hugo

Since we are using Hugo, getting your local site up and running is fairly simple.

#### OS Independent

Since Hugo is cross-platform, and OS choice is far from uniform in this community, I won't go into how to get Hugo functioning on your OS of choice. Follow the [Getting Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). It's not difficult.

Once you can successfully get a version number from the command `hugo version`, you're ready to continue here.

#### Fork and Clone Operations

First thing you'll want to do is Fork the [Github Repository](https://github.com/r-selfhosted-wiki/wiki) for the /r/selfhosted wiki. You'll be working within a repo that syncs with your own accounts' fork of the repository.

Since we use a theme that has its own [Github Repository](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn), there is an extra flag we must add to our `git clone` command.

1. First, clone the forked repo into your local machine. the "recurse-submodules" flag should allow you to automatically pull in the git repo for the theme, as well.

    `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/{YOUR_USER_NAME}/wiki.git`  -- Be sure to modify this url to match your actual username and git repository name.

2. Move to the directory that was just cloned and make sure the `themes/hugo-theme-learn/` folder has content.

    `cd wiki && ls themes/hugo-theme-learn`

3. Once confirmed, copy the example `config.toml` file. Unless you're doing some abstract hosting environment for your local developement machine, this should work as-is.

    `cp config.toml.example config.toml`

4. Run the server locally with the Hugo's server command

    `hugo serve`

You should see some output about the success/launch of the local server, similar to below:

```
$ hugo serve

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:1313` and you should see the site live on your local machine.

You're now ready to start adding and/or editing content.
